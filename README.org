* About
Already got yourself some shiny binutils, coreutils, diffutils, findutils, ...?

You regularly pipe those guys together, producing oneliners from hell?

Ever wished you could fire up those quick n' dirty scripts directly in python?

Now your wildest pipe dreams are just one ~import~ away!

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from pypeutils import Util, printf

  rev = Util("rev")
  output = printf("dog") | rev()
  print(output)

  # Write to stdout using the quick print operator
  ~echo("Kwik-E-Mart")
  ~(echo("lager") | rev())
#+END_SRC
